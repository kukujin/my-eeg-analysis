My EEG Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on EEG (electroencephalography) signal processing using Python. It includes basic data preprocessing, frequency analysis, and visualization techniques to explore brainwave activity.

Features

EEG Data Loading: Reads EEG data using the MNE library.

Preprocessing: Includes filtering and noise reduction.

Frequency Analysis: Computes power spectral density (PSD) to analyze different brainwave bands.

Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate EEG signal characteristics.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: MNE, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
